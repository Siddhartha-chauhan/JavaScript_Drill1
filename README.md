# JS Drill 1: Car Inventory

This project simulates a **used car dealer inventory** with 50 cars.  
It is designed to help practice **JavaScript arrays, objects, and for loops** in a real-world scenario.  

> **Restriction:** Only use `for` loops. Do not use `map`, `reduce`, or `filter`.

---

## Project Structure

- `inventory.js` → Contains the car inventory data  
- `problems/` → Contains solution files:  
  - `problem1.js` to `problem6.js`  
- `test/` → Contains test files for each problem:  
  - `test1.js` to `test6.js`  
- `.gitignore` → Ignores unnecessary files like `node_modules/`, `.vscode/`, system files  

---

## How to Run

- Open terminal in project root  
- Run any test file with Node.js:  
```bash
node test/test1.js
node test/test2.js
node test/test3.js
node test/test4.js
node test/test5.js
node test/test6.js
```

## Notes
- Commit each problem separately for a clean Git history
- .gitignore prevents tracking of unnecessary files
- All logic is inside problems/ and outputs are printed through the test scripts
